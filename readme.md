# Project Title
Automated File Tree Generator

# Description
This project provides a Python script that generates a string representation of a file tree for a given directory and updates a README.md file with the generated file tree. The script allows for specifying directories to ignore during the file tree generation process.

# Features
- Generates a file tree representation of a specified directory.
- Ignores specified directories while generating the file tree.
- Automatically updates a README.md file with the generated file tree.

# Getting Started
# Prerequisites
- Python 3.x

# Installation
- Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/automated-file-tree-generator.git
cd automated-file-tree-generator
```
- Install any required dependencies (if any).

# Usage
- Update the IGNORED_DIRS list in the script to specify any directories that should be ignored during the file tree generation process.
- Update the start_path and readme_path variables in the script to specify the directory to generate the file tree from and the path to the README.md file to be updated.
- Run the script:
```bash
python file_tree_generator.py
```

# Example
Assuming the following directory structure:
```css
scprp/
â”œâ”€â”€ .git/
â”œâ”€â”€ schema/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ items/
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ weapons/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ other_items/
â”œâ”€â”€ main.py
â””â”€â”€ README.md
```
And IGNORED_DIRS set to [".git", "schema/items/weapons"], the generated file tree would look like this:
```css
ðŸ“¦scprp
 â”£ ðŸ“‚schema
 â”ƒ â”£ ðŸ“‚other_items
 â”£ ðŸ“œmain.py
 â”£ ðŸ“œREADME.md
```
The README.md file will be updated to include this file tree under a section titled "File Tree".

    - start_path (str): The starting path of the directory tree.
- Returns:
    - bool: True if the directory should be ignored, False otherwise.
`generate_file_tree(start_path)`
Generates a string representation of the file tree starting from the given path.
- Args:
    - start_path (str): The root path from which to generate the file tree.
- Returns:
    - str: A string representing the file tree.
`update_readme_with_file_tree(start_path, readme_path)`
Updates the README.md file with the generated file tree.
- Args:
    - start_path (str): The root path from which to generate the file tree.
    - readme_path (str): The path to the README.md file to be updated.
